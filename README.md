This is inspired by hangman, a game in which you try to guess a word of a given length by guessing letter by letter (in a limited number of guesses). There is also a "random" guesser that is programed to guess by highest frequency, effectively solving the game (assuming some finite dictionary). This was a project for a DSA class at Berkeley.
